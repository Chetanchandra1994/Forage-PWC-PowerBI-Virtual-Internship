INSIGHTS

Out of the total 7,043 customers analyzed, 1,869 have churned.
Gender distribution among churned customers is fairly balanced, with 50.48% of males and 49.52% of females customers. Only 16% of the Churned customers fall into the senior citizen category and 30% of churned customers have dependents.
The average monthly charge is $452.12k, with a majority of customers opting for month-to-month contracts. Notably, over 88% of churned customers had month-to-month contracts.
75% of churned customers used paperless billing.
57% of churned customers used electronic check as payment method.
70% of churned customers used Fibre Optic as Internet Services.
Churn rates are highest within the first year of customer tenure, with a downward trend observed over time.
999 customers churned within 1 year of subscription. 

RECOMMENDATIONS

Prioritize efforts to retain customers with long-term contracts to mitigate churn rates.
Ensure universal access to internet services to bolster satisfaction and retention levels.
Address service gaps such as online security, backup, device protection, and tech support to proactively prevent churn.
Evaluate the efficacy of paperless billing, particularly among customers with lower charges.
Provide internet access to customers currently without it, thereby promoting engagement with streaming services.

CONCLUSION

In conclusion, the analysis offers actionable insights to enhance customer retention and satisfaction levels. By addressing identified service gaps and optimizing billing methods, we can work towards reducing churn rates and fostering a more positive customer experience.

I look forward to discussing these findings with you further and exploring potential strategies to implement the recommendations.
